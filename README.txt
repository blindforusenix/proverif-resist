The file coercion-resistance-condX.pv contains the ProVerif script for the
verification of condition X in the definition of coercion-resistance.
Condition 1 is verified by an inspection of the syntax. The file
soundness.pv contains the script for the verification of soundness.

To run the scripts, check that ProVerif is in your path and execute

analyzer -in pi filename.pv


For more detail on the installation of ProVerif and on the syntax of
processes, we refer the reader to the ProVerif's manual:

The part of  equational theory referring to zero-knowledge proofs was
automatically generated by our tool to model zero-knowledge proofs in
the applied pi calculus. For more detail on the tool, we refer the
